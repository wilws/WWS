 I once tried to construct a product management application. 
 It used PHP as a backend server without using any frameworks. 
 This PHP backend was built in an MVC pattern with OOP concept to handle product object creation and deletion.  
 Vue was used for the frontend, Apache for the server, and MySql for the database.

 Later, I learned how to create a multi-container application by using Docker.
 I thought it would be great fun if I can build a Docker application that chains PHP, MySql, and VueJs together, and then use a single-line command "docker-compose up" to run all the applications at once.

 This project is a great self-taught lesson that solidified my understanding of using Docker, especially the concept of "Bind Mounts", "Volume" and "Docker Composer". 
  I used Nginx instead of Apache to host the PHP in this Docker project.
