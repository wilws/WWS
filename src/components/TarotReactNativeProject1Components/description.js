    "Tarot Journal" is my team project during the Northcoders course. 
    It is a tarot card application where users can learn how to use tarot cards and the interpretation of each card.
    <br>
    <br>
    I was responsible for the back end construction of this project. The back end of the app was built by NodeJs with TypeScript and Jest was adopted for testing each API endpoint.
    <br>
    <br>
    I also handled the authentication process of the application. When the user is signing up, a 4-digit verification code will send to the user's email.  The code is required to complete the sign-up process.  A JSON Web Token (JWT) will be created and returned in successful sign-up. 
    <br>
    <br>
    For the front end, I took part in configuring the Bottom Tab and Stack navigation in React Native. Moreover, I designed and worked on the authentication procedures and state management when the JWT is returned from the server to React Native.

    The front end of the application is under construction. `,
