  background: `
    
  I like studying stock and finance. That is why I enrolled in a PGDip.in Investment Management and Financial Intelligence after completion of my bachelor's degree. 
  <br>
  <br>
  My investment style is "cash-flow focus", meaning I target majorly on assets that can generate stable cash flow, for example, Corp Bonds, Gov Bonds, REITs, and some high-yield stocks.  
  Therefore, to avoid default risk, I need to analyse the company data to see if the target company has a good debt-asset ratio, healthy cash flow, and steady growth and distribution record,etc.
  <br>
  <br>
  MorningStar is a good tool to collect company data.  However, I need to analyse more than 50 companies. 
  It will be quite time-consuming to download the report one by one, company to company. 
  I hence made a small python app with the use of Selenium to automate the tedious download process.
