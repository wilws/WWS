  background: `NC-News is a full-stack assignment during my Northcoders course. 
        The purpose of this assignment is to build a React application and Node server from scratch. 
        Moreover, this assignment is also a practice of developing software with an Agile approach - 
        "Trello" as Kanban, Excalidraw for drafting ideas and Github's branching & "pull request" for merging approval.

        ></br>
        The backend was built by NodeJs with Jest for testing each API endpoint. The server is deployed in Render and data is stored in ElephantSQL. 
        For the front end,  ReactJs is used with the data management package "Redux". Rest API are used for communication between the front end and the back end.
