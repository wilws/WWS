  <b>What is "Ellow Tradition"?</b><br>
  In  2014, I learned PHP + AJAX + MySQL from books and established "Ellow Tradition", 
  an e-commerce company selling interesting cultural handcraft. Though the business was not successful, 
  the website I created helped me to get a PHP Web Developer job in a radio-control (R/C) hobby Company - AsiaTees.

  <br>
  After the completion of my NodeJs and VueJs online courses in Udemy, I immediately tried to build something by using NodeJs and VueJs. 
  I believe the best way to master newly learned skills is "Practice"! 
  Therefore, I rebuilt "Ellow Tradition" for practice purposes.
