  Who doesn't like art?
  <br>
  <br>
  "NC-Gallery" is one of my ReactJs assignments in Northcoders. 
  This application fires requests to the Art Institute of Chicago's back end and retrieves the data of the art piece. 
  I was deeply attracted by the stunning drawing collection from the institute. 
  That is why I decided to use its API in my assignment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The app is quite a simple one. It uses the useContext( ) hook to collectively handle the fetching and state of images.

  You should like art if you are a front end developer.
  A beautiful art picture is your best friend who can greatly enhance your website's aesthetic.`,
