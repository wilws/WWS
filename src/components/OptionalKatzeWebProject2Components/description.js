  <b>What is an Option?</b><br>
  An option is a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset by a certain date (expiration date) at a specified price (strike price).

  <b>Option Katze</b><br>
  Option Katze was a web application to test the profitability of different options strategies. </br><br>
  The following are the features of Option Katze:</br>
  (1) It scraped option price data from the Internet</br>
  (2) It used the scrapped data to calculate the profit/loss of each strategy</br>
  (3) It generated the result in table. Users could know and compare the maximun loss and gain for each strategy</br>
  </br>

  <b>Arbitrage</b><br>
  It surprised me that the application sometimes could dig out free money.</br>

  <b>Tools Used</><br>
  The application was built in Python with the Django framework and styled with Bootstrap.
  BeautifulSoap was used for data scrapping. The Application was once deployed on Google AppEngine and also joined Google AdSense - in the wish of earning some to cover the expensive hosting cost.
  However, the cost spending in Google AppEngine was so high and I pulled back the application finally.

  Since there is no more maintenance on the application and some of the packages inside are outdated, the whole application could not function properly. Nevertheless, it is a valuable experience to apply programming knowledge to tackle problems encountered in the option market
