  Technical analysis is a methodology for the prediction of the price movement of stock. 
  It is always blamed by fundamental investors that technical analysis is nothing but astrology. 
  Therefore,  to dig out how accurate technical analysis could be, this application was created for back-testing the profitability of different trading signals.

  By clicking the “View Video Demo” button above, 
  you can see the result of buying 0002.HK when RSI is lower than 20 and selling when it is higher than 70.  
  It showed that it is a profitable strategy. However, it doesn’t mean that we can have the same positive result if adopting the same strategy on other assets.

  Due to a lack of maintenance, Option Katze II is no longer working. 
  But the development of this application brought me great satisfaction as I was able to combine the tech and finance knowledge and produced a tool that was potentially useful in decision-making in investment.`,
